# cellml-to-fc
Utilities to help generate / process CellML models to get information required for SPARC FC maps.

Using Andre's "standard" [libCellML python utils](https://github.com/nickerso/libcellml-python-utils) to help get things started.
Really should make that an installable package, but going with a git submodule for now.
